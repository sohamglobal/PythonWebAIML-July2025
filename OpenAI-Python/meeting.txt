Minutes of Meeting – Samsung Mobiles Sales Team
Date: 12 January 2026
Venue: Samsung Regional Office – Sales Conference Room
Attendees: Regional Sales Manager, Area Sales Executives, Marketing Coordinator, Customer Support Lead

Opening & Agenda
The meeting commenced with the Regional Sales Manager welcoming all participants and outlining the agenda. The primary focus was to review Q4 sales performance, discuss strategies for boosting market share in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, and evaluate the effectiveness of recent promotional campaigns. The team agreed to also address customer feedback trends and upcoming product launches scheduled for Q1 2026.
Sales Performance Review
The Area Sales Executives presented detailed reports highlighting strong performance in metropolitan regions, particularly for the Galaxy S series. However, mid-range models such as the Galaxy A series showed slower growth in rural markets. The team noted that online sales channels contributed significantly to overall revenue, with festive season discounts driving higher conversions. Challenges identified included increased competition from Chinese brands and fluctuating demand in certain price segments.
Marketing & Promotions
The Marketing Coordinator shared insights on the recent digital campaigns, emphasizing that influencer collaborations on Instagram and YouTube had improved brand visibility among younger demographics. Traditional retail promotions, however, were less impactful, suggesting the need for more localized campaigns. The team discussed introducing bundled offers with accessories and extending EMI options to attract budget-conscious customers.
Customer Feedback & Support
The Customer Support Lead presented feedback data, noting recurring concerns about battery life and after-sales service delays in smaller towns. The team agreed to escalate these issues to the product and service departments. A proposal was made to strengthen the service network by adding more authorized centers and training staff to handle common technical issues more efficiently.
Action Items & Closing
The meeting concluded with clear action points: (1) intensify marketing in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities with localized campaigns, (2) introduce new promotional bundles for mid-range models, (3) coordinate with service teams to improve after-sales support, and (4) prepare a detailed strategy for the upcoming Galaxy launch. The Regional Sales Manager emphasized accountability and requested progress updates in the next monthly meeting.
