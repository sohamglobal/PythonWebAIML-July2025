Benefits of working from home
As many have come to realize during the pandemic, working from home comes with a host of benefits. Here are a few reasons to consider switching to a career that supports remote work:

Work-life balance: Working from home often comes with a more flexible work schedule. This could help you better manage family responsibilities, hobbies, and other life obligations.

Increased productivity: According to a FlexJobs survey, more than half of respondents (51 percent) said they’re more productive working from home than they are in the office [5].

No commute: The average one-way commute in the US clocks in at 26 minutes [6]. That’s nearly an hour a day or more than four hours a week. Reclaim that time when you work from home. Shorter commutes have also been linked to reduced stress and better health.

Location independence: In the world of remote work, you don’t have to relocate to a new city to get a job. Live where you want and work for the company you want, no matter where they’re located.

Financial savings: When your home is your office, you can save money on gas, parking, childcare, eating out, and even your work-specific wardrobe.

Better health: Working from home can translate to more time for physical activity, less exposure to illness, the option to create an ergonomic workspace, and more opportunities to eat healthier.
