        <hr>
        <p class="para">Interviews play a crucial role in securing IT jobs as 
            they allow candidates to showcase their <b>technical skills</b> 
            and problem-solving abilities beyond their resumes. They 
            help employers assess communication, confidence, 
            and cultural fit, which are equally important in 
            team-based IT environments. Through interviews, 
            candidates can demonstrate practical knowledge of tools, 
            technologies, and real-world project experiences. It also 
            provides an opportunity for job seekers to highlight their
             passion for learning and adaptability to new 
             technologies. Overall, interviews serve as a bridge 
             between theoretical knowledge and practical application,
              determining a candidateâ€™s readiness for the IT industry.
